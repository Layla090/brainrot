        <h2>You feel the power coursing through your veins as you walk away into the sunset, knowing you are the ultimate alpha*</h2>
        <p>[WILLA]
No one's catching me unless I wanna be caught
I'm dancing in the shadows, ain't no leash when I walk
It's great to feel invincible, it's great to feel alive
My appetite's insatiable, there's nowhere it can hide

[WILLA, WEREWOLVES]
Our freedom isn't up to them, it's only up to us (Us)
I'm the alpha, I'm the leader, I'm the one to trust (Trust)
Together we do whatever it takes, we're in this pack for life (Awoo)
We're wolves, we own the night

[WEREWOLVES]
Oh, we own what we own, oh, we own the night
Oh, we own what we own (Awoo), we own the night!
The only thing that is worse than our bark's our bite
Oh, we own what we own (Awoo), we own the night!

[WYATT, WEREWOLVES]
I'm picking up the scent, it seems we're on the right track (Track)
The moonlight's on the rooftops, the wind is at our backs (Backs)
We're living in the shadows, we're living for the chase (Chase)
Our legacy is in our sights, so let's pick up the pace

[WYATT, WEREWOLVES, WYATT & WILLA]
We're on a quest to find the power that's inside of us (Us)
She's the alpha, she's the leader, she's the one to trust (Trust)
Together we do whatever it takes, we're in this pack for life (Awoo)
We're wolves, we own the night</p>
